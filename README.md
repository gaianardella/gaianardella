## 👋 Hi, I'm Gaia!
I'm a Master's student in Data Science at the University of Padua.

For the past three years, I've worked as a Cloud Data Engineer, gaining hands-on experience in designing scalable ETL pipelines, managing cloud infrastructure, and working with big data technologies—all while pursuing my studies.

I enjoy participating in hackathons across Europe 🇪🇺 and meeting other developers, where I can test my creativity and solve complex problems. I have experience in machine learning 🤖, data visualization  📊, predictive modeling 📈, cloud solutions ☁️, and web/app development 📱. 

🚀 I'm also passionate about languages, particularly Scandinavian ones, and always open to collaborating and learning something new!
